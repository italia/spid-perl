=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Net::SPID;
    
    # initialize our SPID object
    my $spid = Net::SPID->new(...);
    
    # generate a LogoutResponse
    my $logoutres = $idp->logoutresponse(
        status          => 'success',
        in_response_to  => $logoutreq->id,
    );
    my $url = $logoutreq->redirect_url;
    
    # parse a LogoutResponse
    my $logutres = $spid->parse_logoutresponse;

=head1 ABSTRACT

This class represents a LogoutResponse. You may need to parse such a response in case you initiated a logout procedure on behalf of your user and you're getting the result from the Identity Provider, or you may need to generate a logout response in case the user initiated a logout procedure elsewhere and an Identity Provider is requested logout to you.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

This class is not supposed to be instantiated directly. You can get one by calling L<Net::SPID::SAML::IdP/logoutresponse> or L<Net::SPID::SAML/parse_logoutresponse>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 xml

This method returns the raw message in XML format (signed).

    my $xml = $logoutreq->xml;

=head2 redirect_url

This method returns the full URL of the Identity Provider where user should be redirected in order to continue their Single Logout. In SAML words, this implements the HTTP-Redirect binding.

    my $url = $logoutres->redirect_url;

=head2 success

This method parses the status code and returns C<success>, C<partial> or C<0>.
