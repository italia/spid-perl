This Perl module is aimed at implementing SPID Service Providers and Attribute Authorities. [SPID](https://www.spid.gov.it/) is the Italian digital identity system, which enables citizens to access all public services with single set of credentials. This module provides a layer of abstraction over the SAML protocol by exposing just the subset required in order to implement SPID authentication in a web application. In addition, it will be able to generate the HTML code of the SPID login button and enable developers to implement an Attribute Authority.

This module is not bound to any particular web framework, so you'll have to do some plumbing yourself in order to route protocol messages over HTTP (see the [example/](example/) directory for a full working example).

On top of this module, plugins for web frameworks can be developed in order to achieve even more API abstraction. See [Dancer2::Plugin::SPID](https://github.com/italia/spid-perl-dancer2) for the well-known [Dancer2](http://perldancer.org) framework. A plugin for Mojolicious is in the works.

## Repository layout

* [example/](example/) contains a demo application based on Dancer2
* [lib/Net/SAML2.pm](lib/Net/SAML2.pm) and [lib/Net/SAML2/](lib/Net/SAML2/) contain a forked and improved version of [Net::SAML2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net::SAML2) (the original module on CPAN is currently unmaintained, so until someone can take over its maintainance we are shipping a more complete one here)
* [lib/Net/SPID.pm](lib/Net/SPID.pm) contains the source code of the Net::SPID module, which is just a wrapper around Net::SPID::SAML and Net::SPID::OpenID
* [t/](t/) contains the test suite

## Prerequisites & installation

This module should be compatible with Perl 5.12+.
Just install it with cpanm and it will install all dependencies automatically:

```
cpanm Net::SPID
```

Or, if you want the latest version from git, use:

```
cpanm https://github.com/italia/spid-perl/archive/master.tar.gz
```
